MapReduce for K-means:

1.
Question 1

Suppose we are operating on a 1D vector. Which of the following operation is not data parallel over the vector elements?
1 point

Add a constant to every element.

Multiply the vector by a constant.

Increment the vector by another vector of the same dimension.

C. Compute the average of the elements.

Compute the sign of each element.

2.
Question 2

(True/False) A single mapper call can emit multiple (key,value) pairs.
1 point

C. True

False


3.
Question 3

(True/False) More than one reducer can emit (key,value) pairs with the same key simultaneously.
1 point

True

C. False


4.
Question 4

(True/False) Suppose we are running k-means using MapReduce. Some mappers may be launched for a new k-means iteration even if some reducers from the previous iteration are still running.
1 point

True

C. False


5.
Question 5

Consider the following list of binary operations. Which can be used for the reduce step of MapReduce? Choose all that apply.

Hints: The reduce step requires a binary operator that satisfied both of the following conditions.

    Commutative: OP(x1,x2)=OP(x2,x1)OP(x_1,x_2) = OP(x_2,x_1)OP(x1​,x2​)=OP(x2​,x1​)
    Associative: OP(OP(x1,x2),x3)=OP(x1,OP(x2,x3))OP(OP(x_1, x_2), x_3) = OP(x_1, OP(x_2, x_3))OP(OP(x1​,x2​),x3​)=OP(x1​,OP(x2​,x3​))

1 point

C. OP1(x1,x2)=max(x1,x2)

C. OP2(x1,x2)=x1+x2−2

OP3(x1,x2)=3x1+2x2

OP4(x1,x2)=x12+x2

OP5(x1,x2)=(x1+x2)/2
